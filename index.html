            <h1>The Hounds Of Winter<h1>
                <h2>Sting</h2><br>
                    <p>Mercury falling
                        I rise from my bed
                        Collect my thoughts together
                        I have to hold my head
                        It seems that she's gone
                        And somehow I am pinned by
                        The Hounds of Winter
                        Howling in the wind</p>
                        
                        <p>I walk through the day
                        My coat around my ears
                        I look for my companion
                        I have to dry my tears
                        It seems that she's gone
                        Leaving me too soon
                        I'm as dark as December
                        I'm as cold as the Man in the Moon</p>
                        <p>I still see her face
                        As beautiful as day
                        It's easy to remember
                        Remember my love that way
                        All I hear is that lonesome sound
                        The Hounds of Winter
                        They follow me down
                        I can't make up the fire</p>
                        <p>The way that she could
                        I spend all my days
                        In the search for dry wood
                        Board all the windows and close the front door
                        I can't believe she won't be here anymore
                        I still see her face</p>
